As part of its 2021-2026 action plan 📅, CASNOS aims to improve service quality for its users (members, social insurance contributors, and retirees) through the outsourcing of services (e-services) 💻.

The organization’s IT department is considering an integrated digital solution that will facilitate decision-making and guide the development of its future activities 🧠.

To achieve this, it is essential to implement a robust and powerful integrated BIG DATA platform capable of handling OLTP queries under high load while providing reduced latency ⏱️. Additionally, for analytical purposes (OLAP), the digital platform should also deliver added value in data analysis for better decision-making 📊 (modern business intelligence, machine learning for actuarial purposes and fraud detection, etc.) 🤖. Finally, from an infrastructure perspective, the platform must be scalable and maintainable to adapt to the internal and external evolution of the organization 🔧.

In conclusion, the primary goal of this graduation project is to contribute to the realization of this strategy through:

Proposing a Lambda/Kappa architecture oriented towards microservices (Docker, Kubernetes) 🏗️ and Microsoft technologies (SQL Server 2019) 💻.
Aligning the BIG DATA ecosystem with specific use cases (real-time dashboards, SMS notifications, etc.) 📈📲.
Introducing the DEVOPS methodology within the CASNOS IT team 🔄.
